# Upload Metadata Lab

There are 3 different ways from where you can upload metadata samples.

1. Filling the information in metadata lab form
2. Upload Metadata Excel file
3. Using SFTP server.

We are going to describe the different options and requirements that any alternative has, so you can use the method that you fit better for you. 

The option 1 (Filling the information in metadata lab form) you do not need to prepare any file in advance, just only filling the information in the form that is guiding you.

Option 2 (Upload Metadata Excel file). You need to fill in advance the Metadata Lab excel file

The last alternative (Using SFTP server) is not available from relecov. You need to upload the Excel metadata file to the sftp server. Detailed information how to do upload this file is described in [How to fill metadata lab excel](/documentation/metadataLabExcel)


If you decide to use the alternative 1 or 2, click on the left side menu the "Upload Metadata" link, to display the page to upload your metadata.

Because some data will be stored in iSkyLIMS, the system checks the connection
towards iSkyLIMs to verify that it is running. If it is not reachable then a error message is presented. Under this scenario it is not allowed to progress, until the issue is solved.

When you are in the Metadata Form page you can see that there is information about the userid who is logged and the Laboratory that this user belongs to. 

Please check that this information is accurate, because the data that you are uploaded will contain this information.

There are many fields that are requested to fill. In order to reduce the "duplicated" information, we have divided the metadata fields in 2 groups.
- Fields that are different from one sample to another.
- Fields that are common to all sample that you are going to upload.

Following this premises, the have split the input of Metadata in 2 pages. 

The one you see now is excel type form, where you can type the information directed on  each cell or copy and paste the fields, if you already has stored in excel.

As you will see in this form there are 3 types of data:
- Text. Typing the information.
- Dates. Clicking on the cell to open a calendar to select the date.
- Select. Press on the cell to display and choose the option that fit in your case.
